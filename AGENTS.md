# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/index.tsx` is the Bun server entrypoint.
- `src/client/frontend.tsx` boots the React app.
- `src/client/App.tsx` is the primary UI surface.
- `src/backend/*` contains backend routes, business logic, and storage integrations.
- `src/shared/*` contains shared modules used by both client and backend.

## Shared Code Rules
- Put code in `src/shared/*` only when both client and backend use it.
- If code is frontend-only, keep it in `src/client/*`.
- If code is backend-only, keep it in `src/backend/*`.

## Coding Style
- Language: TypeScript + React function components
- Styling: favor Tailwind utility classes with DaisyUI components
- Keep imports organized/sorted according to Biome's `organizeImports` rule before finishing edits.
- If you are making code changes in a file longer than 500 lines, try to split the code into smaller modules/components in a meaningful way.
- Prefer failing hard over catching errors and setting defaults, only catch exceptions if you can meaningfully recover from the error
- Keep the surface area of `try/catch` blocks as small as possible.
- Use `try/catch` only at boundaries calling external libraries or platform APIs that throw exceptions.
- For internal code paths, model failures with `typescript-result` instead of throwing/catching exceptions.
- Add logs that make it easier to understand what is happening at runtime

## Libraries & Tooling
- Zod for input validation
- React Query for state management
- React Router for routing
- Tailwind + DaisyUI for styling

## Architecture
- Use the standard 3-layer architecture:
  - Routes define the APIs.
  - Services define the business logic.
  - Repositories interact with the database only.

## Completion Checklist
- Before making any code changes, do a constraints check:
  - Read every `AGENTS.md` file that applies to directories you will modify.
  - List those files and the key constraints you will follow for this task.
- If the change introduces major user-facing functionality, operational workflow changes, or adds/changes environment variables, update `README.md` to reflect the new behavior and setup requirements.
- When you are finished, run `bun run format`.
- Then run `bun run lint`.
- Then run `TMPDIR=/tmp XDG_CACHE_HOME=/tmp/.cache BUN_INSTALL_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/.bun bun install`.
- Then run `bun run typecheck`.
- Then run `bun run knip`.
- If removing an API from client usage, check whether it is still used in backend code paths; if not, remove the backend API route/service logic too.
- If the user gives process or architecture feedback, update the relevant `AGENTS.md` file(s) in the same change so the preference is captured for future tasks.
- Do not run `format` and `lint` in parallel; run them sequentially to avoid stale-file race conditions.
- Fix any issues reported by these commands before considering the task complete.
